        <h2>Experience</h2>

        <h3>World Cube Association Software Team</h3>
        <p>
            I am on the World Cube Association Software Team (WST).
            The WST maintains the WCA website, tools, infrastructure
            and other software that is needed to run the WCA. I help
            maintain and improve the website of the WCA. At the moment
            I am helping migrate to React from Ruby on Rails.
        </p>

        <h3>Work Experience at JumpTech</h3>
        <p>
            I spent a week working with the silicon-fen startup JumpTech.
            During the week, I created some documentation and examples
            for their API using Postman. I then created a GraphQL
            client in TypeScript which was used by pen-testers when
            testing that API. I then did some pre-pentest pen testing
            of their site, before picking up their TypeScript general
            utilities project. I went into their office for 4 days and
            worked remotely the last day. I attended daily standup,
            organised and went to meetings, and did pair programming
            with the senior devs and worked independently throughout
            the week.
        </p>

        <h3>InvestIn Internship</h3>
        <p>
            This 5-day computer science internship covered full-stack
            development, cybersecurity, building AI, big data and more.
            I learnt how to pen-test a website; program front-end
            applications in JavaScript, CSS and HTML, develop a KNN
            learning algorithm using excel, and all alongside professionals
            in each aspect of the week.

        <h2>Personal Projects</h2>
        Most of my projects can be found on my
        <a href="https://github.com/revers3ntropy">GitHub</a>.

        <h3>Halcyon.Land</h3>
        <p>
            <i>SvelteKit, TypeScript, MySQL, Playwright, Apache</i>
            <a href="https://halcyon.land" target="_blank">Halcyon.Land</a>
            is a journaling and life logging site I created with SvelteKit.
        </p>

        <h3>Oxynium</h3>
        <p>
            <i>Rust</i>
            Oxynium is an AOT compiled, statically typed, multi-paradigm,
            general-purpose programming language.
            It has a powerful static type system with generic types, classes and primitives.
            Classes support static or instance methods, operator overloading and more.
            It has an intuitive syntax and compiles to native machine code, making it
            blazingly fast - or write inline assembly using the macro system.
            It has a basic standard library and import system.
        </p>

        <h3>Entropy Script</h3>
        <p>
            <i>TypeScript</i>
            Entropy Script is the scripting language for Entropy Engine.
            It uses a syntax similar to TypeScript and Go, and has functions,
            variables, classes, objects, error handling,
            tracebacks, runtime type checking and more.
            It is written entirely from scratch in TypeScript and Javascript:
            it takes in a string, tokensises, parses and interprets it to run
            the code.
            I have also made a translator for it which compiles Entropy Script
            into JavaScript and Python.

        <h3>Sorting Algorithm Visualiser</h3>
        <p>
            <i>React.js, JS, HTML, CSS</i>
            Watch sorting algorithms work with this aesthetically
            pleasing sorting algorithm visualiser
            <a href="https://revers3ntropy.com/ess/sorting/build">here</a>.
            This was my first React project and taught me how to use the framework.
        </p>

        <h3>Physics Simulator</h3>
        <p>
            <i>Javascript, HTMl, CSS</i>
            In this, you can run many different simulations using a
            ball collision physics engine. This project was great in
            combining physics, maths and computer science for me.
            You can play around with it
